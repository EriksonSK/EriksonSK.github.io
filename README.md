Hi üëã My name is Erik B√©la
==========================

data scientist and python developer
-----------------------------------

I started programming in high school as preparation for my high school diploma in computer science. Since then I have been trying to improve. I was mainly interested in robotics and artificial intelligence. Even though I know some basics of robotics, such as constructing simple systems using e.g. Raspberry Pi, arduino or ESP8266, sensors, actuators and controller, I rather focus on software.

*   üåç  I'm based in Ko≈°ice
*   ü§ù  I'm open to collaborating on Interesting projects and Job offers
*   ‚ö°  I am interested in information technology as such, and the more interested I am, the faster I learn new skills
