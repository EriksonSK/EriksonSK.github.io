Hi üëã My name is Erik B√©la
==========================

data scientist and python developer
-----------------------------------

I started programming in high school as preparation for my high school diploma in computer science. Since then I have been trying to improve. I was mainly interested in robotics and artificial intelligence. Even though I know some basics of robotics, such as constructing simple systems using e.g. Raspberry Pi, arduino or ESP8266, sensors, actuators and controller, I rather focus on software.

*   üåç  I'm based in Ko≈°ice
*   ü§ù  I'm open to collaborating on Interesting projects and Job offers
*   ‚ö°  I am interested in information technology as such, and the more interested I am, the faster I learn new skills

Projects
==========================

Pursuit of prey
----------------

The aim of this work is to simulate a basic biological instinct in nature, which is the pursuit of prey, which is part of prey hunting. At work, the role of the predator is provided by the mobile robot TurtleBot 3 Burger. In the simulation, the sensors of the mobile robot are used to detect the distance from other objects and to detect the object that is being chased. The project was divided into two parts. The first part consisted of a simulation of chasing prey in the open source application Webots. In the second part, after the successful simulation in the first part, the project was moved from the virtual environment to the physical environment.
